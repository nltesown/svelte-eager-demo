# Eager bar Svelte component

An eager bar is a DOM block element, typically at the top of the document (like a nav or menu).

If the document is scrollable, then, as the document is being scrolled down, the eager bar leaves the viewport like it would with the default positioning. Whenever the document is scrolled up, it re-enters the viewport immediately.

Reference the `Eager.svelte` component, and enclose the desired HTML in `<Eager></Eager>`.

This is an early version.
